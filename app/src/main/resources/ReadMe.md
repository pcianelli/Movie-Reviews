### Build a command line movie review application. 
The application should:
- let the user add a movie to the system, 
- then add one or more reviews to it. 
- The application should also give the user the option to lookup a movie by the movieâ€™s title and display each review. 

You should build this application from scratch using gradle init to get started. You should also create a git repository and push it to your personal GitHub account. You will likely need to copy and paste some elements from previous exercises and projects.
